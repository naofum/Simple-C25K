This is a personal repo for some modifications to [Simple C25K](https://github.com/roelb/Simple-C25K), a 5K trainer for Android. I've only tested these changes on my own phone.

# Changelog

## 2017-07-09
 - Imported everything into Android Studio which significantly changed the folder structure
 - Updated minimum SDK to 16 (Android 4.1)
 - Made notification content show when sensitive notifications are masked on the lock screen (this was the main reason for forking)
 - Changed notification icon (not great, still needs work)
