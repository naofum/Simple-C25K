This is a personal repo for some modifications to [Simple C25K](https://github.com/roelb/Simple-C25K), a 5K trainer for Android. I've only tested these changes on my own phone.

Although currently the original repo doesn't display a license, I reached out to the author roelb and he confirmed "this project is licenced under GPL3.0".
